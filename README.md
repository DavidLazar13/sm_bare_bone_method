# Action Item: The Bare Bone Method

In this Action Item you will: 
1. Use the `Bare Bone Method` to 10X your development speed in the frontend
2. Practice `state architecture` in the front-end by working with local and global state
3. Write `component` and `end-2end` tests to ensure quality

We provide the starting code for this app so you can jump straight into the action. The following three challenges are based on **REAL interview tasks**:

## Challenges:
1. [COMPETENT] Extend the `MainPage` to contain a view of the `Now Playing` movies
2. [COMPETENT] Add a `Search` and a `Pagination` to the MainPage
3. [PROFICIENT] Add a global language switch to the page
4. [EXPERT] Extend the `MoviePage` to show the movie cast and other movies each actor also did


### Getting Started
1. You will need an API Key to make the requests to the API. You can get one [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
2. Check the `package.json` to see the scripts available. Run `npm start` to run the app.
